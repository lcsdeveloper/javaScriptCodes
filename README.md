# Java Script Folder

Hey everyone this is my repository for java script codes which i am using for studying it.

Here you will be able to see some examples which i am checking from the MDN Documentation
and some books as Eloquent Java Script 3 Edition and Java Script Grammar.

#### Codes which you can see in this folder
##### Conditionals
  * && || != 
  * IF ELSE
  * SWITCH
> Also in this folder you will find simple codes without conditionals although i decided to put inside this folder as it is a simple code.
